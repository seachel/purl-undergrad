# purl-undergrad
The final project in a compilers class during my undergraduate degree (April 2014) was a compiler to translate from a knitting pattern DSL to the standard pattern notation while checking correctness of pattern definitions.

See [here](http://chelsea.lol/purl-undergrad/) for the tool implemented as part of this project, and [here](http://chelsea.lol/Resources/Purl.pdf) for the corresponding report and code written using literate programming techniques.
